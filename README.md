# Supermarket Sales Dashboard

This project showcases a **Power BI dashboard** I created using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales). The purpose of this project is to learn and practice creating insightful dashboards using real-world data.

## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains historical sales data from a supermarket company operating in 3 different branches over 3 months. For more details about the dataset, visit its [Kaggle page](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales).

## Data Preparation
Before creating the dashboard, I performed basic **data cleaning** and formatting using **Microsoft Excel**, which included:
- Checking for missing values.
- Formatting data types.
- Ensuring consistency across columns (e.g. dates).

## Dashboard Highlights
The dashboard includes:
1. **Revenue Analysis**:
   - Total revenue, gross income, and profit percentages.
   - Monthly and hourly revenue trends.
2. **Branch Analysis**:
   - Performance comparison across three branches.
   - Top-performing branch identification.
3. **Product Analysis**:
   - Sales performance by product line.
   - Gender-based product preferences.
4. **Customer Behavior**:
   - Membership type distribution (normal vs. member).
